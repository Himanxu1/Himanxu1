## Tech
I'm not much obsessed with the frameworks or tool , I choose and can pick up 
the right tool according to the business need .
Here's what I know and still exploring 
1. Frontend - [ I love to work with js because i truely understand this language underneath (as a i have explored how  beautiful it works and what cool features it gives us)(js,reactjs,nextj)]
2. Backend - [mostly worked with node + ts backend , typeorm, mysql database ]
3. Asynchronous Communication - [message queue (bee-queue,bullmq)]
4. Mobile -  [ react native - have worked with mobile developement in my recent org where i have redesigned screens , fix workflows , upgrade versions and a lot more]
5. Devops -  [ here i know a little bit , i know terraform as i have to write congif for staging so i learn it in a day or 2 , have set up (machince,database,firewall rules) ]
